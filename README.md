# ML-Tests

This repository is dedicated to experimenting with various **Machine Learning** concepts and ideas. There is no specific goal or project focusâ€”it's a space for testing out algorithms, models, and new techniques.

## Repository Status

Currently, the repository is empty but will be updated with machine learning tests and experiments over time.

## Areas of Interest (Planned)

- Testing different machine learning algorithms (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning)
- Exploring libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn
- Experimenting with data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training and evaluating models on sample datasets
